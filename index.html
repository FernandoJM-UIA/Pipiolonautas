          <ul>
              <li><strong>Mercury:</strong> The closest planet to the Sun.</li>
              <li><strong>Venus:</strong> Earth's "sister" planet, but with a hostile environment.</li>
              <li><strong>Mars:</strong> The Red Planet, target of ongoing exploration for potential signs of life.</li>
              <li><strong>Jupiter:</strong> The gas giant, famous for its Great Red Spot.</li>
              <li><strong>Saturn:</strong> Known for its stunning ring system.</li>
              <li><strong>Uranus:</strong> An ice giant with a unique sideways rotation.</li>
              <li><strong>Neptune:</strong> The farthest known planet in our solar system.</li>

          <h2>The Future of Space Exploration</h2>
          <p>
              The future of space exploration holds the promise of new discoveries, human settlements on other planets, and possibly 
              even contact with extraterrestrial life. NASA is working on the Artemis program, which aims to land the first woman and the next 
              man on the Moon by 2024. The goal is to build a sustainable presence on the Moon and use it as a launch pad for Mars.
